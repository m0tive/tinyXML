Changes in version 1.0.1:
- Fixed comment tags which were outputing as '<?--' instead of 
  the correct '<!--'.
- Implemented the Next and Prev methods of the TiXmlAttribute class.
- Renamed 'LastAttribtute' to 'LastAttribute'
- Fixed bad pointer to 'isspace' that could occur while parsing text.
- Errors finding beginning and end of tags no longer throw it into an
  infinite loop. (Hopefully.)

Changes in version 1.0.2
- Minor documentation fixes.

Changes in version 1.0.3
- After nodes are added to a document, they return a pointer
  to the new node instead of a bool for success.
- Elements can be constructed with a value, which is the
  element name. Every element must have a value or it will be
  invalid, but the code changes to enforce this are not fully
  in place.

Changes in version 1.1.0
- Added the	TiXmlAttributeSet class to pull the attributes into
  a seperate container.
- Moved the doubly liked list out of XmlBase. Now XmlBase only
  requires the Print() function and defines some utility functions.
- Moved errors into a seperate file. (With the idea of internationalization
  to the other latin-1 languages.)
- Added the "NodeType"
- Fixed white space parsing in text to conform with the standard. 
  Basically, all white space becomes just one space.
- Added the TiXmlDeclaration class to read xml declarations.
