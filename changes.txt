Changes in version 1.0.1:
- Fixed comment tags which were outputing as '<?--' instead of 
  the correct '<!--'.
- Implemented the Next and Prev methods of the TiXmlAttribute class.
- Renamed 'LastAttribtute' to 'LastAttribute'
- Fixed bad pointer to 'isspace' that could occur while parsing text.
- Errors finding beginning and end of tags no longer throw it into an
  infinite loop. (Hopefully.)

Changes in version 1.0.2
- Minor documentation fixes.

Changes in version 1.0.3
- After nodes are added to a document, they return a pointer
  to the new node instead of a bool for success.
- Elements can be constructed with a value, which is the
  element name. Every element must have a value or it will be
  invalid, but the code changes to enforce this are not fully
  in place.

Changes in version 1.1.0
- Added the	TiXmlAttributeSet class to pull the attributes into
  a seperate container.
- Moved the doubly liked list out of XmlBase. Now XmlBase only
  requires the Print() function and defines some utility functions.
- Moved errors into a seperate file. (With the idea of internationalization
  to the other latin-1 languages.)
- Added the "NodeType"
- Fixed white space parsing in text to conform with the standard. 
  Basically, all white space becomes just one space.
- Added the TiXmlDeclaration class to read xml declarations.

Changes in version 1.2.0
- Removed the factory. The factory was not really in the spirit 
  of small and simple, confused the code, and was of limited value.
- Added FirstChildElement and NextSiblingElement, because they
  are such common functions.
- Re-wrote the example to test and demonstrate more functionality.

Changes in version 1.2.1
- Fixed a bug where comments couldn't be inside elements.
- Loading now clears out existing XML rather than appending.
- Added the "Clear" method on a node to delete all its children.

Changes in version 1.2.2
- Fixed TiXmlAttribute::Previous actually returning "next." Thanks
  to Rickard Troedsson for the bug fix.

Changes in version 1.2.3
- Added the TIXML prefix to the error strings to resolve conflicts
  with #defines in OS headers. Thanks to Steve Lhomme.
- Fixed a delete buf that should be a delete [] buf. 
  Thanks to Ephi Sinowitz.

Changes in version 1.2.4
- ReplaceChild() was almost guarenteed to fail. Should be fixed,
  thanks to Joe Smith. Joe also pointed out that the Print() functions
  should take stream references: I agree, and would like to overload
  the Print() method to take either format, but I don't want to do 
  this in a dot release.
- Some compilers seem to need an extra <ctype.h> include. Thanks
  to Steve Lhomme for that.

Changes in version 2.0.0 BETA
- Made the ToXXX() casts safe if 'this' is null. 
  When "LoadFile" is called with a filename, the value will correctly get set.
  Thanks to Brian Yoder.
- Fixed bug where isalpha() and isalnum() would get called with a negative value for 
  high ascii numbers. Thanks to Alesky Aksenov.
- Fixed some errors codes that were not getting set.
- Made methods "const" that were not.
- Added a switch to enable or disable the ignoring of white space. ( TiXmlDocument::SetIgnoreWhiteSpace() )
- Greater standardization and code re-use in the parser.
- Added a stream out operator.
- Added a stream in operator.
- Entity support, of predefined entites. &#x entities are untouched by input or output.
- Improved text out formatting.
- Fixed ReplaceChild bug, thanks to Tao Chen.

Changes in version 2.0.1
- Fixed hanging on loading a 0 length file. Thanks to Jeff Scozzafava.
- Fixed crashing on InsertBeforeChild and InsertAfterChild. Also possibility of bad links being
  created by same function. Thanks to Frank De prins.
- Added missing licence text. Thanks to Lars Willemsens.
- Added <ctype.h> include, at the suggestion of Steve Walters.

Changes in version 2.1.0
- Yves Berquin brings us the STL switch. The forum on SourceForge, and various emails to
  me, have long debated all out STL vs. no STL at all. And now you can have it both ways.
  TinyXml will compile either way.

Changes in version 2.1.1
- Compilation warnings.

Changes in version 2.1.2
- Uneeded code is not compiled in the STL case.
- Changed headers so that STL can be turned on or off in tinyxml.h
