Changes in version 1.1:
- Fixed comment tags which were outputing as '<?--' instead of 
  the correct '<!--'.
- Implemented the Next and Prev methods of the TiXmlAttribute class.
- Renamed 'LastAttribtute' to 'LastAttribute'
- Fixed bad pointer to 'isspace' that could occur while parsing text.
- Errors finding beginning and end of tags no longer throw it into an
  infinite loop. (Hopefully.)
